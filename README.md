##🚨 Real-Time Cyberbullying Detection System using NLP & ML (Fog-Edge Optimized)
This project implements a real-time cyberbullying detection system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to identify harmful or abusive content across digital platforms. 
Designed with a fog-edge computing architecture, the system minimizes data transmission by 60%, improving privacy and reducing latency.

##🔍 Key Features:

Trained and evaluated 4 ML models: K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Linear SVC
Achieved peak accuracy of 85% on benchmark datasets
Uses TF-IDF vectorization and text preprocessing for efficient NLP
Fog-edge deployment ensures lightweight, privacy-preserving inference at the edge
Integrated with Flask + Streamlit for interactive and seamless deployment


## 📌 Deployment
- Local: Flask & Streamlit-based interface
- Edge: Optimized for deployment on fog/edge nodes
