## 🚨 Real-Time Cyberbullying Detection System using NLP & ML (Fog-Edge Optimized)
- This project implements a real-time cyberbullying detection system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to identify harmful or abusive content across digital platforms. 
- Designed with a fog-edge computing architecture, the system minimizes data transmission by 60%, improving privacy and reducing latency.

## 🔍 Key Features:
- Trained and evaluated 4 ML models: K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Linear SVC
- Achieved peak accuracy of 85% on benchmark datasets
- Uses TF-IDF vectorization and text preprocessing for efficient NLP
- Fog-edge deployment ensures lightweight, privacy-preserving inference at the edge
- Integrated with Flask + Streamlit for interactive and seamless deployment
